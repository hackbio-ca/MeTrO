## Abstract

A concise summary of the project's goals, the problem it addresses, and its intended audience. This section can include potential use cases and key features.

## Download datasets
Download data from [https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009337#sec028](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009337#sec028) S1 File.

## Installation

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate metr

pip install -I -e .
...
```

### R environment
```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge r-base r-rcpp r-igraph r-biocmanager
```

```R
BiocManager::install("mixOmics")
```

## Quick Start

Provide a basic usage example or minimal code snippet that demonstrates how to use the project.

```python
# Example usage (Python)
import my_project

demo = my_project.example_function()
print(demo)
```
```r
# Example usage (R)
library(my_project)

demo <- example_function()
print(demo)
```

## Usage

This tool is run as a set of scripts from the command line. The primary control method of training the VAE in this package is a set of config files in `config/`. See `config/default.yml` for the comprehensive set of model and training parameters and what they may look like. Any specified subset of these parameters can be overwritten by providing a custom config. For example:

```
python scripts/run.py -c config/test.yml
```
The above code will train a VAE for a single epoch on a random 1% subset of the data used to train the full model. For the standard settings of a full VAE training run:
```
python scripts/run.py -c config/control.yml
```
```r
# More usage examples (R)
library(demoProject)

demo <- advanced_function(parameter1 = "value1")
print(demo)
```
