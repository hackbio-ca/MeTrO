## Installation

Python environment
```
python -m venv metro
pip install torch pandas tqdm pyyaml
pip install -I -e .
...
```

### R environment
```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge r-base r-rcpp r-igraph r-biocmanager
```

```R
BiocManager::install("mixOmics")
```

## Quick Start

Given a metabolic or transcriptomic profile, MeTrO can encode either to a mutually shared latent space and then decode it into the other (or back to the original in a probabilistic manner).

The following workflow is planned:

```python
import my_project

model = my_project.load_model(state_dict.pkl)
z = model.encode(metabol_profile)
recon_metabol = model.decode_m(z)
recon_transcript = model.decode_t(z)
```

```r
# Example usage (R)
library(my_project)

demo <- example_function()
print(demo)
```

## Usage

This tool is run as a set of scripts from the command line. The primary control method of training the VAE in this package is a set of config files in `config/`. See `config/default.yml` for the comprehensive set of model and training parameters and what they may look like. Any specified subset of these parameters can be overwritten by providing a custom config. For example:

```
python scripts/run.py -c config/test.yml
```
The above code will train a VAE for a single epoch on a random 1% subset of the data used to train the full model. For the standard settings of a full VAE training run:
```
python scripts/run.py -c config/control.yml
```
```r
# More usage examples (R)
library(demoProject)

demo <- advanced_function(parameter1 = "value1")
print(demo)
```
